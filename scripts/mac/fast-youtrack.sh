# The 'exec' command replaces the current process, effectively restarting the script.
# If the python block successfully installed and exited with 1, the exec runs again.
# If the python block found Tk and exited with 0, this check fails, and script continues.
# If brew failed inside the python block, python block exits with 1, and the exec will just fail again immediately.
# Let's refine the exit logic here slightly for clarity:
# If python script exits with 1, it means install was needed OR install failed.
# We only want to re-exec if the install *might* have succeeded.
# A simpler check is just the exit code == 1 from the initial python block.
# If it exited 1 because brew *failed*, the re-run will likely also fail, but that's okay,
# the user will see the brew errors from the previous attempt.
